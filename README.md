# TODO:X and O representations

#Consider 16 small boxes arranged in a line, and 3 red stones and 3 black stones. Initially, the stones are placed in the boxes as follows (Os represent red stones, Xs represent black stones):
#In a move, two adjacent stones must be taken out of the boxes, then they must be put into two adjacent empty boxes preserving their order. The goal of the game is to arrange the stones in the following order:


Accomplished 
Able to Run the code which is able to print out 
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| O | O | O | X | X | X |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
As this outcome show it proves who ever gets this is the winner of the game
So the purpose of the my code is to play the game up to 10 matches after 10 games are played it shows the top 10 results with the players name how may steps taken and the date and time as well.


Requirements
The program must store the result of the games as follows.
For each game, the following information must be stored: the date and time when the game was started/finished, the name of the player, the number of moves made by the player during the game, and the outcome (the puzzle is solved/given up). The program must show a high score table in which the top 10 results are displayed
